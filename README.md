Hello everyone! 

This is a mini set up I had done for score keeping between two players. 
It is perfect for those who enjoy mini games to keep score than the traditional way of paper and pencil. 

The final score can be changed by entering a number into the blank box and click enter. 

The score will increase increment by score of 1 when clicking either "Player One" or "Player Two". 

Once the score had reached the final set score, 
the point can not be added and the winner will be decided with the highlighted color score!

If you decided to start another game, click the reset button and set the new score. 

Best of luck!
